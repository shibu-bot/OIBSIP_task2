                    University of Calcutta</li>
                <li><span class="year">1921 </span>- After coming fourth in ICS (Indian Civil Services) examination and
                    getting selected, he resigned from his civil service job as he did not want to work under an alien
                    government which would mean serving the British. He wrote to his elder brother Sarat Chandra Bose:
                    "Only on the soil of sacrifice and suffering can we raise our national edifice". Started the
                    newspaper named "Swaraj".</li>

                <li><span class="year">1943 </span>- After being disillusioned that Germany could be of any help in
                    gaining India's independence, he left for Japan</li>
                <li><span class="year">1941</span>- founded the Free India Center in Berlin, and created the Indian
                    Legion (consisting of some 4500 soldiers) out of Indian prisoners of war who had previously fought
                    for the British in North Africa prior to their capture by Axis forces</li>
                <li><span class="year">1942</span>- Azad Hind Radio was a propaganda radio service that was started

                    crashed in Japanese-ruled Formosa (now Taiwan), but this has been hotly disputed and never
                    confirmed. There are still some in India today who believe that Bose remained alive and in Soviet
                    custody, a once and future king of Indian independence</li>

                <q>Netaji's name is one to conjure with. His patriotism is second to none. His bravery shines through
                    all his actions. He aimed high but failed. Who has not failed?</q>
